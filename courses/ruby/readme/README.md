# OOP

In this exercise you should completely understand Ruby OOP model, dealing with design patterns and .yml files. 

All your code should be inside your module, besides you should get needed data from `.yml` file, also created by you. 

For example your module name is "MyApp", then the line `c = MyApp.config` should return the *instance of the class*, created inside your module. Moreover, every instance must have the same ID, so you should use one of the design patterns for achieving this goal.

In your `.yml` file data should be organized like hash. For example:

```
"configs.yml"

app1_name: chromium
app2_name: telegram-desktop
app3_name: atom

```
First of all, read all the given resources attentively and only after that start working on your code.
